## Key Capabilities

- **Instant AI-Powered Analysis**  
  Paste or upload any UI component (React, Vue, Svelte, HTML, CSS, or plain text) and receive an in-depth, AI-generated analysis—within seconds.

- **Holistic Component Understanding**  
  Extracts and explains purpose, user flows, and UI/UX structures for any component, enabling a deeper understanding and better architectural decisions.

- **Risk & Issue Identification**  
  Identifies a spectrum of issues including:
  - Functional bugs
  - Usability and accessibility (A11Y) gaps
  - Performance bottlenecks
  - Implementation anti-patterns

- **Targeted, Actionable Suggestions**  
  AI generates precise, preventative strategies and ready-to-implement fixes based on detected risks and industry best practices.

- **Developer Checklists**  
  Automatically distills analysis into concise, actionable checklists—ensuring high standards, consistency, and peace of mind throughout the development lifecycle.

- **Structured, Exportable Reporting**  
  Results are presented in a structured format (cards, flowcharts) and can be exported as professional PDF reports for compliance, documentation, or team sharing.

- **Privacy-First & Secure**  
  User analyses are securely stored and accessible only to the authenticated user. No code or results are shared with third parties.
