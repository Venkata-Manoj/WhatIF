## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 60%, 50%) which converts to RGB hex value #4DA6FF, offering a balance between technological trustworthiness and approachability. This color works well in both light & dark modes. Suggested Logo: A stylized question mark encapsulated within a speech bubble, using the primary color. The question mark could be subtly animated to pulse or morph slightly.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) which converts to RGB hex value #F0F5FF, for a light and unobtrusive backdrop that supports prolonged screen time. This adapts well to dark mode by inverting to a darker shade of blue/gray.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 50%, 50%) which converts to RGB hex value #40BFBF, providing clear visual cues without overpowering the main color scheme. Call to action buttons should be of this color; ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility in both light and dark modes.
- Body text and headlines: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its modern, neutral appearance and excellent readability, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Responsive layout optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility across different screen sizes.
- Use a subtle loading animation (e.g., a spinner) during analysis execution to improve user experience and signal processing.
- Consider creating a set of icons that are easily recognizable in both light and dark modes. These could be variations of the same icon or entirely different icons, depending on the context.
